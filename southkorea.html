      <h4>The Joys and Challenges of Staying in Korea</h4></br>
      <p>In April and May of 2024, I fulfilled a long-kept dream of mine: I took a month off from work, packed my suitcase with only the necessary basics (to keep a lot of room for all the nice things I already planned on taking back home from there) and took an 11-hour flight to Seoul Incheon Airport. I had been affiliated with Korean culture (i.e. South Korean culture) for at least a decade – be it the amazing food varieties the cuisine of this country has offer, the heart-warming and -breaking drama series, or the beautiful sing-songy and poetic language based on Hangeul. </br> Together with my husband, I planned a fully individual itinerary for the trip – we came along Seoul, Andong, Busan, Ulsan, Yeosu, Jeju, and back to Seoul. This travel trip was one of the most insightful and enlightening experiences of my life, with countless joyful moments as well as many challenges to face. In the following, I want to share my experiences with you.</p></br>
    <h5>Seoul</h5></br>
    <p>Before we boarded the plane, we had of course spent weeks and weeks doing extensive research on the place, its cultural idiosyncrasies and mannerisms, where to go, how to get there, and which services on our phone might be available to get along. In theory, all that information is great – but once confronted with it in practice, it feels quite intimidating at first. Since I had been watching Korean drama series for the last ten years, I had acquired some basic Korean language skills. That helped a lot especially in listening to when people talk. Many Koreans are not very comfortable to talk in English, but when you approach them in their language, they smile at you, and they try to help you as best as they can. In general, Koreans are very polite and mindful – whether you are on the train and everyone is quiet, or whether you visit one of the many free and completely clean (!) public toilets.</br></br>
    Something that was quite tricky to get used to in the beginning, was the lack of navigation services you are used to using in literally any other country on the planet. Google Maps does not work in South Korea – at least their navigation option. There is a law that prevents geographical data from being stored on foreign servers. So you have to fall back on a physical map and a compass to navigate your way through Korea. Unless you are open to using the Korean equivalents to Google Maps: Naver Maps or Kakao Maps. We chose the first one, and even though it took some time getting used to it (given that certain elements were only in Korean), it proved itself as a helpful companion, especially for using public transportation.</br></br>
    Also, the phone business is tough terrain for Google. You won’t be able to buy a Pixel phone in Korea – I guess Samsung’s predominance is too big an obstacle, even for a huge multinational corporation like Alphabet. Thus, it can also be quite tricky for Pixel users to find working SIM-Cards, as was the case for my husband. When you reach the airport, you will find multiple shops that sell SIM-Cards as well as E-SIMS. Getting an E-SIM for my IPhone was not an issue, it worked immediately after purchase and connected to the Korean network. For my husband’s Pixel we had to check several SIM-Card providers, but at least at the airport we eventually found one that was working without any limitations. At that point we were fully equipped with the necessary technology, and so our adventure could begin.</br></br>
    We took the train from Incheon Airport to Seoul. The public transportation in Korea is very advanced and efficient. Residing in Germany and being exposed to Deutsche Bahn, it’s a very peculiar feeling to look at a train schedule at the station with all the trains on it having 0 minutes delay. You will also have your own personal T-Money card which you can charge with a certain amount of money, and then use it for public transportation and even in convenience stores. Whenever you enter a bus or the metro, you scan your card – and then you scan it again once you leave. This modern approach to technology followed us throughout our stay in Korea. Once we reached our destination, we left the underground station and felt like we were in a Sci-Fi movie. The buildings were huge, glassy towers. So many of them had enormous screens attached to them playing commercials, and making you question how much energy they actually must consume.</br></br>
    What excited me enormously about Korea is the fantastic cuisine! We have had a variety of Korean dishes in a multitude of different Korean restaurants in Germany. And I have become somewhat of a semi-professional chef of Korean myself – even though only in my own apartment. But as they say: If you love a food or cuisine of a place, go to the source. Hence, I did! The first thing we tried was of course the streetfood. We stayed in a very lively neighborhood in Hongdae. In many side streets you could find people selling foods for affordable prices: corndogs, chicken skewers, Kimbap, fish cakes, Tteokbokki, Mandu, Sundae, to name a few. Needless to say that we tried all of them. Before we could even think about going to a restaurant, we had filled up on street food already. Koreans had mastered the art of using basic ingredients and making delicious dishes or snacks out of them. Another big cultural thing is Cafés. You find them at every corner: big chains like Starbucks and A Twosome Place, and even cute small owner-run Café that we used to frequent basically everyday (twice). If you’re a coffee lover Korea is your heaven. What also struck me, was the kind of minimalism that I had not seen before. South Korea is not a big country, but it has a lot of people. It was astonishing how Koreans were able to make use of the limited space they had to put something in it. You looked at a small building and assumed it contained one shop. But then you were walking around the corner and there was just another entrance leading down to another shop. Needless to say that on top of the previous shop, there was another one. It appeared very efficient, and only rarely claustrophobic.</br></br>
    A challenge we faced was certainly the language. Thankfully, I could communicate using some basics of the Korean language, and over time it got better so that I could even talk briefly to people on the train. Korean appear very reserved at first, hardly any emotion in their faces, and they don’t feel comfortable in English. But once you try to approach them in their language and break the ice, they’re very interested in you and your story. The first time I ordered a corn dog at a stall of an old Korean lady, she could only say the price in Korean. Which we of course didn’t understand. She then showed us her hand, making some sort of sign with her thumb and little finger to signal the number. Before we could try to interpret it, however, a young man sitting in that stall told us “Six-thousand five-hundred”. But we worked our way trough the country, and we managed to make use of Korean whenever we could, even if it was only greeting people.
